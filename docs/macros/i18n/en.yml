    what_year_q: "What year is it? It seems like only yesterday they were saying that a privacy coin couldn’t be pruned
    and that ASICs will win in the end. But here we are... about to prune and talking about
    RandomX... wearing our space helmets. RandomX still must go through the process of becoming
    tried and true, but it’s an exciting part of Monero’s pipeline. This guide gives an
    overview of its nature and plans, and where you can learn more."
    what_is_randomx: "_What is RandomX_"
    what_is_randomx_p1: "RandomX is a new Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm that Monero is scheduled
    to begin using in the next network update. RandomX is designed to be ASIC resistant by
    using random code execution and memory-hard techniques to prevent specialized mining
    hardware from dominating the network. Because RandomX is optimized for general-purpose
    CPUs, the network will become more decentralized and egalitarian in the distribution of
    block rewards."
    what_is_randomx_p2: "Visit [github.com/tevador/RandomX](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX)
    for more details or watch Howard Chu (hyc) speak about [RandomX at Monero Konferenco](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs/blob/master/monero-outreach-docs%2Fen%2Ftranscriptions%2Fmonero-konferenco-2019%2FASIC-Resistant_Proof_of_Work-Fact_or_Fantasy.md).
    At the time of writing, RandomX is beginning the auditing process with [Trail Of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/),
    [X41](https://www.x41-dsec.de/), [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/) and the
    [Kudelski Group](https://www.nagra.com/). RandomX is scheduled to go live during the next
    Monero network update."
    what_is_randomx_p3: "RandomX has two modes with different memory requirements and
    performance. _Fast Mode_ requires 2GB of shared memory but has 4x-6x the performance of
    _Light Mode_ which only requires 256MB of RAM. _Fast mode_ is intended for dedicated
    miners. _Light mode_ is designed to allow fullnodes to validate blocks without requiring
    the 2+GB of RAM, so that small devices (like ARM single-board computers, e.g. Rock64) can
    still be used as standalone nodes."
    randomx_collab: "_RandomX Collaboration_"
    randomx_collab_p1: "RandomX was developed for Monero by tevador, hyc, vielmetti, antanst
    and SChernykh. Already other organizations are interested in adopting it. [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/),
    a serverless storage enabler donated the Trail of Bits audit to the Monero community and
    will be implementing RandomX before Monero for their unique application. Arweave provides
    an innovative cryptocurrency-based approach to decentralized, long-term data storage.
    Mining on Arweave relies on both proof of work and—as a new concept unique to
    Arweave—proof of access. Arweave miners are incentivized through proof of access to
    replicate and have quick access to data stored in the network."
    randomx_collab_p2: "[Wownero](http://wownero.org/) is also launching RandomX in their
    upcoming v0.6 update and will call it RandomWOW. RandomX code will be updated after the
    audits are complete, so there will be some code divergence by the time Monero forks in
    October. Another difference is that RandomWOW will have a smaller scratchpad for hashing,
    1MB instead of 2MB, smaller number of VM execution iterations, and increased chained VM
    executions per hash to increase program compilation cost for GPUs."
